"""Skill version + shared HTTP header helper.

The ``VERSION`` file at ``skills/clawtraces/VERSION`` is the single
source of truth. Every HTTP request the Skill makes carries
``X-Skill-Version: <semver>`` so the Server's version gate can reject
clients running below ``MIN_SUPPORTED_SKILL_VERSION``.

Bumping protocol: edit ``VERSION`` (one line, no whitespace). The
publish-clawhub.sh script verifies the file matches the ``--version``
argument before pushing to ClawHub so the two cannot drift.
